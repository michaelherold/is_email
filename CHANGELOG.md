## [0.1.1](https://github.com/michaelherold/is_email/tree/0.1.1) - 2023-06-18

- Add support for parsing email addresses according to the relevant RFCs and outputting either a boolean or a diagnosis. This is and will continue to be the default behavior of `IsEmail.email?`.

## 0.1.0

- An initial push that wasn't vetted thoroughly enough and missed updating the changelog with the release date. Otherwise, this was identical to 0.1.1.
